# Call for Papers

**Submission:**  October 16, 2020 (midnight Pacific Time) <br>
**Notification:** October 31, 2020 <br>
**Workshop:** November 14 and 15, 2020


We invite papers that target creativity, robotics and the arts,
design, and engineering related challenges: including new
algorithms, systems, methodology, datasets, evaluations, surveys, reproduced
results, and negative results.

Contributions to this workshop are required to provide a clear definition for
the concept of Creativity. Additionally, contributions are expected to discuss
how their research contributes to a "common language" that advances the
holistic notion of the concept of creativity across fields. 

Topics of interest for all kinds of submissions include, but are not limited to:
- Algorithms to simulate creativity in social robots
- Curiosity in social robots
- Creativity applications of social robots, including educational, healthcare, in-home, entertainment, among others
- Humor and jokes in social robots
- Long-term creativity between humans and robots
- Creative content generation in robots
- Outcomes of interaction with a creative robot
- Human perception of creative robots
- Artistic applications of robots reporting creativity outcomes, including poetry, music, design, visual arts, performances
- Creativity as domain-specific or a domain-general in social robots
- Computational creativity for social robots
- Group versus individual creativity in human-robot interaction
- Creativity measurement in human-robot interaction
- Co-creation with social robots
- Robot embodiments and aesthetics for creativity fostering
- Creative process versus creative outcome
- Measuring human experiences in creating with robots
- Identifying key aspects of human creativity for machine design

### Submission Requirements

Submissions to Creativity and Robotics Workshop at ICSR 2020 are limited to
6 pages of content (minimum 4 pages), but may contain an unlimited
number of pages for references and appendices. The latter may not
necessarily be read by the reviewers. We request and recommend that
authors rely on the supplementary material only to include minor
details that do not fit in the 6 pages. The submission process is
double-blind. All submissions must be formatted with LaTeX using
the [ICSR 2020 paper
format](https://sites.psu.edu/icsr2020/submission/)

Submission: Email paper to creativity.robotics@gmail.com

We welcome articles currently under review or papers
planned for publication elsewhere. However, papers that have been
published at an another archival conference should not be submitted. Accepted
papers will be published on the Creativity and Robotics homepage, but are to be
considered non-archival.
