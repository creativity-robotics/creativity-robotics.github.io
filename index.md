title: Creativity and Robotics
subtitle: at ICSR 2020

# Overview
Creativity is now emerging at the front line of research in the
interdisciplinary field of Social Robotics. There are many
important lines of investigation within creativity and robotics.
Some include designing and developing robots that can integrate and
facilitate creativity in humans, solve problems creatively, provide
"out of the box" ideas, act curiously, and extend the human
potential by achieving tasks that neither the robot nor the human
could do alone. 

This workshop aims to bring together these lines of investigation
and debate existing challenges under the research topic of
Creativity and Robotics. The 1st Creativity and Robotics workshop
will be a virtual workshop at ICSR 2020. Our goal is to explore the
creative potential a robot offers as well as
whether society will engage with such robots.

This workshop is endorsed by Frontiers via a new research topic on
"[Creativity and
Robotics](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/14181/creativity-and-robotics}{``Creativity)" in Frontiers in Robotics and AI Journal launched by
the organizers of this proposed workshop.

# Program 

The workshop will employ a variety of interactive tools such as
breakout rooms, word clouds, and polls to learn from our audience
on common themes, help our speakers better tailor their talks, and
generally enhance the experience for our audience.

We expect this workshop will benefit researchers by providing new networking
opportunities and, through our Frontiers research topic, fostering continued
research in this field.  The output of the workshop will be a short summary
paper containing the speakers' and audience's challenges for the future,
burning research questions and other remarks collected throughout.

# Keynote 

We are excited to announce that **Professor Todd Lubart** will be our keynote
speaker for the workshop. 

Todd Lubart is Professor at the University Paris Descartes where
he directs the activity of the Laboratoire Adaptations Travail
Individu (LATI). He earned his PhD from Yale University in 1994
under the supervision of Robert Sternberg and soon after that
moved to the University of Paris Descartes where he became an
Assistant Professor in 1995 and then Professor of Psychology in 2002. 

He was a member of the Institut Universitaire de France
(2005-2010). His work on creativity is extensive and includes
approximately 75 publications, articles, books and book chapters
covering various aspects of the phenomenon: creative process,
individual differences, role of cognition and emotion,
environmental and cultural factors, etc. His current work develops
a multivariate approach to creativity.
